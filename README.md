Along with Dave Rupert, I'm the co-host of a podcast called [ShopTalk](https://shoptalkshow.com), a show about (you guessed it), building websites.

I've spoken at events and given workshops all over the world. I've also written three books: [The Greatest CSS Tricks Vol. I](https://css-tricks.com/books/greatest-css-tricks/), [Practical SVG](https://abookapart.com/products/practical-svg), and [Digging Into WordPress](https://digwp.com/book/).
